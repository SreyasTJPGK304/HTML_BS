        <p>It was a hot summer day. A lion was feeling very hungry.

            He came out of his den and searched here and there. He could find only a small hare.
            
            He caught the hare with some hesitation. <q>This hare cannot fill my tummy</q> thought the lion.
            
            As the lion was about to kill the hare, a deer ran that way.
            <p/><i>The lion became greedy</i>.
                
            <ins>He is very violent.</ins>
            He thought, <q>Instead of eating this small hare, let me eat the big deer</q>.
            
            He let the hare go and went behind the deer. But the deer had vanished into the forest.
            
            The lion now felt sorry for letting the hare off.</p>
